## Hey there 👋

I’m **Maneka**, a Computer Systems Engineering undergraduate.

I enjoy understanding how systems behave rather than just how they look. When something interests me, I tend to model it, simulate it, break it, and then try to make it more efficient or reliable.

A lot of my work revolves around **system and network simulations**, including projects done in **MATLAB**, where the goal is to analyze performance, constraints, and real-world behavior rather than build polished interfaces.

I also work on full projects where **web development** plays a supporting role — mainly as a way to interact with the system — while my main focus stays on **architecture, logic, and infrastructure**.

In my current project, I’m closely involved with the **DevOps side of things**: managing repositories, working with branch workflows, keeping builds consistent, and making sure different parts of the system integrate smoothly.

You’ll find a mix of academic, experimental, and practical projects pinned here — most of them built to learn how systems actually work under the hood.
